## **Description**

The purpose of this assignment was to write code to generate a ReadMe file using the command line.  If you’re reading this now, then it is functional as it was generated using this very code.  I also added a “start” property with a value of “node .” so that you can just run the code by typing “node .” while you’re in the “readmegenerator” file instead of typing “node index.”  The next iteration of this would be to use an alias for the current path file so that I can use it in any file and it’ll pop the README out onto the desktop.
